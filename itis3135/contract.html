        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>
            I, <strong>Cai Li</strong> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my <strong>Fall 2025</strong>, <strong>ITIS3135</strong>, <strong>Front-End Web App Development</strong> with my instructor, <strong>Professor D.I. von Briesen</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
        </p>
