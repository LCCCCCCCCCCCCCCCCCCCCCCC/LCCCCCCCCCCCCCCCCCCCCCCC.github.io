        <h2>FCC Full Stack JavaScript Outline</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Current Progress Note:</strong> I am currently working through the CSS curriculum (446/1173 steps completed). The JavaScript curriculum outlined below has not yet been started, as I am focusing on completing the CSS foundation first.</p>

        <p><strong>Note about this outline:</strong> Due to FreeCodeCamp's ongoing website updates and redesign, detailed step counts and descriptions for individual sections are no longer easily accessible on the platform. The JavaScript curriculum currently contains approximately 1,038 total steps across 23 sections listed below. This table provides the section names as they appear on FreeCodeCamp and my current progress status for each.</p>

        <h3>My Learning Plan and Schedule</h3>
        
        <p>I, Cai Li, acknowledge the FreeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer JavaScript curriculum outlined above. However, I want to be transparent about my current situation and realistic learning plan:</p>

        <h4>Current Status (as of November 8, 2025):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CSS Curriculum:</strong> 446/1173 steps completed (38%)</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript Curriculum:</strong> Not yet started (1,038 total steps across 23 sections)</li>
            <li><strong>Time Remaining:</strong> Approximately 4 weeks until end of semester</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Realistic Schedule:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Weeks 1-4 (November 8 - December 6, 2025):</strong> Focus on completing as much of the CSS curriculum as possible. Given my current course load including projects, exams, and assignments across all subjects, my primary goal is to finish the CSS sections. If I can complete the CSS curriculum by semester end, that would be a significant achievement.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript Sections:</strong> To be addressed after CSS completion. I understand that the JavaScript curriculum is extensive (23 sections, approximately 1,038 steps total) and will require dedicated time that may extend beyond this semester.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Acknowledgment:</h4>
        <p>I acknowledge that this FreeCodeCamp Full Stack JavaScript certification is a single comprehensive assignment within this course and is not broken into smaller graded parts. I take full responsibility for pacing myself and understand that my progress will be self-directed. While I am committed to learning this material, I am being realistic about what can be accomplished given my current academic workload and the remaining time in the semester.</p>

        <p>I am focusing on building a strong foundation in HTML and CSS first, as these are essential prerequisites for effectively learning JavaScript. Once I have completed the CSS curriculum and have a break in my academic schedule, I will be better positioned to dedicate focused time to the JavaScript sections.</p>
