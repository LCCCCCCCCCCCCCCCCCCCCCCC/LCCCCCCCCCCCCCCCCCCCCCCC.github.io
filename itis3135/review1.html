        <h3>Evaluation Process Note</h3>
        <p>I spent considerable time reviewing the class spreadsheet to find peers to evaluate. After checking almost all students, I found that eligible peers either already had two reviewers assigned or had not yet published their CLIENT PROJECT. This peer was assigned to me from the available options.</p>

        <h3>Website Checklist Evaluation</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Submission and File Structure:</strong> The main site URL is accessible, but contains minimal content. The homepage shows only one hyperlink, which leads to a 404 error page when clicked. No CLIENT PROJECT content was found.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Design - Contrast and Readability:</strong> Unable to evaluate as the CLIENT PROJECT page does not exist. The main page has minimal content to assess.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Design - Standard CSS Usage:</strong> Cannot evaluate CLIENT PROJECT CSS implementation as the project page has not been created.</li>
            
            <li><strong>CRAP Principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity):</strong> Unable to evaluate for CLIENT PROJECT. The main page structure is too minimal for meaningful assessment.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Page Structure (Header, Main, Footer):</strong> The main page does not demonstrate proper HTML5 semantic structure. CLIENT PROJECT structure cannot be evaluated as it has not been published.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Header with Site/Brand Name:</strong> Unable to evaluate CLIENT PROJECT header requirements.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Main Content with Page Name (h2):</strong> Cannot evaluate CLIENT PROJECT page structure as it does not exist.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Brand Tagline:</strong> Unable to verify presence on CLIENT PROJECT.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Footer Requirements:</strong> Cannot evaluate CLIENT PROJECT footer elements including navigation menu and validation buttons.</li>
            
            <li><strong>HTML and CSS Validation:</strong> No CLIENT PROJECT page available to validate. The main page cannot be properly validated due to missing content and broken links.</li>
            
            <li><strong>CLIENT PROJECT Specific Requirements:</strong> As of December 2, 2025, no CLIENT PROJECT content is published. The only link on the homepage results in a 404 error. The assignment cannot be evaluated in its current state.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Additional Observations and Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Good:</strong> The main URL is accessible on the UNCC webspace server.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The CLIENT PROJECT Part 2 assignment does not appear to exist.</li>
                    <li>The main page contains only one link, which is broken (404 error).</li>
                    <li>Most course assignments appear to be incomplete or unpublished.</li>
                    <li>No proper HTML structure or navigation is present.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li>Implement proper HTML5 semantic structure (header, main, footer).</li>
