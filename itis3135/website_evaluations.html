            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple.com</a></h3>
            <p>
                Apple's website is a great example of clean, modern design. It's easy to navigate 
                and looks very professional with beautiful product images and simple organization.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contrast:</strong> Apple uses great contrast with large product images 
                    against white or black backgrounds. The headings are much bigger than body text, 
                    and the blue buttons clearly stand out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition:</strong> The site uses the same fonts, colors, and layouts 
                    on every page. All product cards look identical with consistent spacing and button 
                    styles, making everything feel unified.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything lines up perfectly in organized columns 
                    and rows. Nothing looks randomly placed, which makes the site look clean and 
                    professional.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proximity:</strong> Related information is grouped together nicely. Prices 
                    are near buy buttons, and there's good white space between sections so you can 
                    tell what goes together.

            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
            <p>
                The Yale School of Art website is one of the worst-designed sites on the internet. 
                Despite being from a famous art school, it's messy, hard to use, and breaks most 
                basic design rules.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contrast:</strong> The site has terrible contrast with random background 
                    colors that make text hard to read. There's no clear hierarchy, so you can't tell 
                    what's important.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition:</strong> There's no consistency at all. Every page uses different 
                    colors, fonts, and layouts. The navigation changes on each page, making it feel 
                    like random pages stuck together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are scattered everywhere with no clear structure. 
                    Text and images are placed randomly, making it look messy and unprofessional.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proximity:</strong> Related information is spread far apart while unrelated 
                    things are too close together. There's barely any white space, making the layout 
                    cramped and confusing.
