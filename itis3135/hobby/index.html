            <h2>When to Practice Photography?</h2>

            <p>The beauty of photography is that every moment offers potential. However, certain times provide optimal lighting and conditions for specific types of photography. Understanding when to shoot can dramatically improve your results and expand your creative possibilities.</p>

            <p>Golden hour, occurring shortly after sunrise and before sunset, provides warm, soft light that's ideal for almost any type of photography. Blue hour, the period of twilight before sunrise and after sunset, offers a magical quality perfect for landscape and cityscape photography. Midday light, while harsh, can create dramatic shadows and high-contrast scenes.</p>

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How to Get Started with Photography?</h2>

            <p>Beginning photography doesn't require expensive equipment. Start with whatever camera you have - even a smartphone. Learn the fundamentals: exposure (aperture, shutter speed, ISO), composition (rule of thirds, leading lines), and lighting. These basics apply whether you're using a phone or professional gear.</p>

            <p>Understanding the exposure triangle is crucial. Aperture controls depth of field and light amount, shutter speed freezes or blurs motion, and ISO adjusts sensor sensitivity. Balancing these three elements allows you to capture properly exposed images in various lighting conditions while achieving your creative vision.</p>

            <h2>Why Practice Photography?</h2>

            <p>Photography offers numerous benefits beyond simply taking pictures. It encourages you to observe the world more carefully, noticing details, light, and moments you might otherwise miss. This heightened awareness enriches daily life and cultivates mindfulness. Photography becomes a meditative practice, helping you stay present and engaged.</p>

            <p>Creative expression through photography provides emotional outlet and personal fulfillment. Whether documenting family memories, exploring artistic visions, or telling important stories, photography gives you a powerful voice. It's a universal language that transcends cultural and linguistic barriers, allowing you to communicate ideas and emotions visually.</p>

            <p>Photography preserves memories and documents history. Family photographs become treasured heirlooms, while photojournalism captures important events for future generations. Your images create a visual legacy, telling your story and the stories of those around you. In an increasingly digital world, photographs remain our most powerful memory keepers.</p>

            <p>For many, photography evolves from hobby to passion to profession. Even if you never pursue it commercially, the skills you develop - patience, observation, technical knowledge, creativity - transfer to other areas of life. Photography challenges you to see differently, think creatively, and continually learn and grow.</p>

            <h2>AI Prompts Used - Learning Process</h2>

            <p><strong>AI Model Used:</strong> Claude by Anthropic</p>
            <p><strong>Learning Context:</strong> I am currently at CSS progress 173/1156 (completed Basic CSS only). I have not learned JavaScript yet in my course. The assignment requires JavaScript for the show/hide sections functionality, so I needed AI assistance for those parts while handling HTML/CSS structure myself.</p>

            <h3>Initial Planning:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "I have an assignment requiring sections that hide/show like different pages. I know basic HTML and CSS but haven't learned JavaScript yet. The assignment says I can use AI. Can you explain what approach I should take - do I need JavaScript for this, or can it be done with CSS only?"</p>
            <p><em>AI explained that while some hide/show can be done with CSS :target selector, JavaScript provides better control for this use case. Since I haven't learned JS yet, AI offered to help with that specific part.</em></p>

            <h3>Navigation and Styling:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "I want my navigation to be centered and the links to have consistent spacing. Should I use padding or margin between links? And how do I center the entire nav bar?"</p>
            <p><em>AI explained using text-align: center on the nav element for centering, and using margin for spacing between links. Suggested inline-block display for nav links to control spacing better.</em></p>

            <h3>JavaScript for Show/Hide:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "I need JavaScript to hide all sections except the one clicked. Since I haven't learned JavaScript in my course yet, can you help me understand what this code needs to do and provide a simple function I can use?"</p>
            <p><em>AI provided a showSection() function explaining: it loops through all sections removing the 'active' class, then adds 'active' only to the selected section. The CSS handles actual hiding via display:none.</em></p>

            <h3>CSS Classes for Visibility:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "If JavaScript adds/removes a class called 'active', how do I write the CSS so sections are hidden by default but shown when they have that class?"</p>
            <p><em>AI explained: set 'section { display: none; }' for default hidden state, then 'section.active { display: block; }' to show active sections. This was within my CSS knowledge but I needed confirmation of the approach.</em></p>

            <h3>Section Animations:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "I want smooth transitions when sections appear/disappear instead of instant show/hide. I learned basic transitions for hover effects, but how do I apply that to elements appearing on the page?"</p>
            <p><em>AI explained using CSS animations with @keyframes for fadeIn effect, and how to apply animation properties to sections when they become active. Showed how to combine opacity and transform for smooth appearance.</em></p>

            <h3>Box Shadow for Depth:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "I want my content boxes to look like they're floating above the background. I've heard of box-shadow but don't understand the parameters. How do I create that effect?"</p>
            <p><em>AI explained box-shadow syntax: horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, spread radius, and color. Suggested starting with '0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)' for a lifted effect and experimenting with values.</em></p>

            <h3>Layout Organization:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "My sections have lots of content (paragraphs, tables, forms, images). How do I organize the spacing between these elements so it looks clean and professional, not cluttered?"</p>
            <p><em>AI suggested using consistent margin-bottom values for elements, grouping related content closer together (CRAP proximity), and using larger spacing between major sections. Recommended creating a spacing system (like 1rem, 1.5rem, 2rem).</em></p>

            <h3>CRAP Principles:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "The assignment mentions CRAP principles. I understand it stands for Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity but how do I apply these in my CSS?"</p>
            <p><em>AI explained: Contrast through color choices, Repetition by using consistent spacing/colors, Alignment with text-align and flexbox basics, Proximity by grouping related elements with margins. Suggested focusing on consistent padding/margins throughout.</em></p>

            <h3>Image Handling:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "Some of my images are landscape and some are portrait orientation. How do I make them all look consistent in the layout without manually cropping each one?"</p>
            <p><em>AI advised using max-width: 100% and height: auto maintains aspect ratio, and suggested using consistent styling (border-radius, box-shadow) to create visual unity even with different dimensions. Mentioned that figures naturally help group images with captions.</em></p>

            <h3>Default Section Display:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "The 'What' section needs to show first when page loads. Do I add the 'active' class in HTML or use JavaScript?"</p>
            <p><em>AI explained two options: add class directly in HTML (simpler), or use JavaScript DOMContentLoaded event. Since I'm using JS anyway, suggested the JavaScript approach for consistency.</em></p>

            <h3>Color Scheme Selection:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "Assignment says color scheme must be different from main site. My main site uses [other colors]. How do I choose colors that work well together? I picked purple but what color text works with purple backgrounds?"</p>
            <p><em>AI suggested using light text (#f0f0f0) on dark/purple backgrounds for readability, and dark text (#333) on white content boxes. Mentioned checking contrast ratios for accessibility.</em></p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> All images used in this website are from Unsplash.com under the Unsplash License (free, open-source photography). These are real photographs, not AI-generated images.</p>

            <h3>Debugging Help:</h3>
            <p class="ai-prompt"><strong>My Question:</strong> "When I click navigation links, nothing happens. How do I check if the JavaScript is working? I don't know how to debug JavaScript."</p>
            <p><em>AI explained: open browser Developer Tools (F12), check Console for errors, use console.log() to test if function is being called, verify onclick attributes are correctly written in HTML.</em></p>
