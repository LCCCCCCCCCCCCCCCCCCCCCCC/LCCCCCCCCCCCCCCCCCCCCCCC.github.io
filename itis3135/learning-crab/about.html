            <h2>About Learning Crab</h2>
            <p>Learning Crab is my coffee cart business idea for this web design project. I picked a crab theme because I like the beach and thought it would be fun to have shell-shaped coffee mugs. The cart would sell specialty drinks with ocean-inspired names like Sea Salt Latte and Tidal Mocha. It's called "Shell-Shocked" because the flavors are supposed to surprise you. Right now this is just a concept for class, but I'm learning a lot about HTML and CSS while building this site.</p>
