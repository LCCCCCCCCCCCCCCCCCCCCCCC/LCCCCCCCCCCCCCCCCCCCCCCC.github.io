            <h2>Shell-Shocked Coffee Cart</h2>
            <p>Shell-Shocked Coffee Cart is a mobile coffee cart that serves drinks in unique crab shell-shaped mugs. We offer ocean-themed specialty coffees like Sea Salt Caramel Latte, Tidal Mocha, and Coral Cold Brew. Our goal is to give coffee lovers a fun and surprising experience with every cup.</p>
            <p>The Learning Crab brand combines two things I care about: coffee culture and coastal vibes. We use fair-trade beans and add creative flavors inspired by the beach. Whether you need a quick espresso or want to relax with a cappuccino, we've got you covered with drinks that stand out from the ordinary.</p>
