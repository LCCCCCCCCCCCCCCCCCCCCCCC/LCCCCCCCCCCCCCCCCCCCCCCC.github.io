        <p style="background-color: #ffffcc; padding: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #ffcc00;"><strong>Update:</strong> Dylan published his CLIENT PROJECT after my initial review, so I've updated this evaluation to reflect the current version of his site.</p>

        <h3>Evaluation Process Note</h3>
        <p>I spent considerable time reviewing the class spreadsheet to find peers to evaluate. After checking almost all students, I found that eligible peers either already had two reviewers assigned or had not yet published their CLIENT PROJECT. This peer was assigned to me from the available options.</p>

        <h3>UPDATED EVALUATION - December 5, 2025</h3>
        <p><em>The following evaluation reflects the current state of the CLIENT PROJECT after it was published:</em></p>

        <h4>Updated Website Checklist Evaluation</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Submission and File Structure:</strong> The CLIENT PROJECT is now accessible at the provided URL. The project is titled "TrailShare CLT" and includes multiple pages (index, about, skills, trails, contact). File naming appears to follow proper conventions.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Design - Contrast and Readability:</strong> The project demonstrates good contrast and readability overall. Text is easily readable against backgrounds.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Design - Standard CSS Usage:</strong> The project uses default.css for styling, maintaining consistency with course requirements.</li>
            
            <li><strong>CRAP Principles:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Good contrast between text and backgrounds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Design elements (buttons, colors, fonts) are consistent across pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Content is properly aligned and organized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements are appropriately grouped together.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Page Structure (Header, Main, Footer):</strong> The project includes proper HTML5 semantic structure with header, main, and footer sections. Navigation menu is present and functional.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Header with Site/Brand Name:</strong> Header properly includes the brand name "TrailShare CLT" in an h1 tag without including page-specific names, which follows the checklist requirements.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Main Content with Page Name (h2):</strong> The main content area properly uses h2 for page titles (e.g., "Upcoming Group Hikes" on the Trips page).</li>
            
            <li><strong>Brand Tagline:</strong> No visible brand tagline or slogan was found on the pages. A consistent tagline should be added to strengthen the brand identity.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Footer Requirements:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Navigation Menu:</strong> The footer does not include a navigation menu linking to user's other ITIS3135 pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>HTML Validation:</strong> No HTML validation button/link is present in the footer.</li>
                    <li><strong>CSS Validation:</strong> No CSS validation button/link is present in the footer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>HTML and CSS Validation:</strong> Validation buttons are missing, so validation status cannot be easily verified by visitors.</li>
            
            <li><strong>CLIENT PROJECT Functionality and Progress:</strong> The project demonstrates a functional multi-page website for a hiking community platform. It includes informative content about the organization, upcoming events, and contact information. The project shows good progress and practical application of web development skills.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Specific Issues Identified</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dark Mode Issues:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Skills Page:</strong> The dark mode toggle does not function properly on the skills page.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact Page:</strong> When dark mode is activated on the contact page, form labels become invisible (black text on dark background). The form displays "Name:" and "Email:" but the text is not visible, creating a usability issue.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Missing Required Elements:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brand tagline/slogan is not present</li>
                    <li>Footer navigation menu to other ITIS3135 pages is missing</li>
                    <li>HTML and CSS validation buttons are not included</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fix Dark Mode:</strong> Debug the JavaScript for dark mode functionality, especially ensuring form labels remain visible on the contact page (change text color to white or light gray when dark mode is active).</li>

                    <li><strong>Test All Features:</strong> Thoroughly test all interactive features (especially dark mode) across all pages before final submission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Accessibility:</strong> Ensure all text has sufficient contrast in both light and dark modes.</li>
                </ul>
