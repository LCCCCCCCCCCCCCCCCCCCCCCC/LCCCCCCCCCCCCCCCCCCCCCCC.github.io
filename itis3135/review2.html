        <h3>Evaluation Process Note</h3>
        <p>I spent considerable time reviewing the class spreadsheet to find peers to evaluate. After checking almost all students, I found that eligible peers either already had two reviewers assigned or had not yet published their CLIENT PROJECT. This peer was assigned to me from the available options.</p>

        <h3>Website Checklist Evaluation</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Submission and File Structure:</strong> The main site is accessible at the provided URL and shows evidence of completed coursework. However, no CLIENT PROJECT content was found linked from the homepage or in expected locations.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Design - Contrast and Readability:</strong> The main site demonstrates reasonable contrast and readability in completed assignments. However, the CLIENT PROJECT page is not available to evaluate for this specific assignment.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Design - Standard CSS Usage:</strong> Previous assignments show CSS implementation. Cannot evaluate CLIENT PROJECT CSS implementation as the project page does not exist.</li>
            
            <li><strong>CRAP Principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity):</strong> The main site shows understanding of basic design principles in completed work. Unable to evaluate for CLIENT PROJECT specifically.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Page Structure (Header, Main, Footer):</strong> The main site demonstrates proper HTML5 semantic structure in some assignments. CLIENT PROJECT structure cannot be evaluated as it has not been published.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Header with Site/Brand Name:</strong> Previous assignments show proper header implementation. Unable to evaluate CLIENT PROJECT header requirements.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Main Content with Page Name (h2):</strong> Earlier work shows understanding of heading hierarchy. Cannot evaluate CLIENT PROJECT page structure as it does not exist.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Brand Tagline:</strong> Unable to verify presence on CLIENT PROJECT.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Footer Requirements:</strong> Previous pages include footer elements. Cannot evaluate CLIENT PROJECT footer elements including navigation menu and validation buttons.</li>
            
            <li><strong>HTML and CSS Validation:</strong> No CLIENT PROJECT page available to validate.</li>
            
            <li><strong>CLIENT PROJECT Specific Requirements:</strong> As of December 2, 2025, no CLIENT PROJECT content is published or linked from the main site. The assignment cannot be evaluated in its current state.</li>
        </ul>
